A PHP implementation of OpenAI's GPT-3 model, ChatGPT. 

## Getting Started

1. Sign up for an OpenAI API key at https://beta.openai.com/signup/
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key
3. Run the code on your local server or on a hosting service that supports PHP

## Usage

The Api takes a `prompt` string as an input and returns the response generated by the ChatGPT model.

You can also adjust the `model`, `max_tokens` and other parameters according to your needs.
